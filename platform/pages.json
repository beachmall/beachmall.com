Many options are available to suit your individual needs and tastes to ensure you receive the best value for your hard earned money. For easy transportation of beach chairs and coolers, you want to consider [[Beach Carts]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.beach-cart/] for comfort.\n\n\n\n\n'''High Beach Chairs'''\n\n\nThe traditional high-seat folding beach chair is constructed of rust resistant aluminum and mesh. This option is very light and easy to simply grab and go. Folding beach chairs provide a simple place to rest, but offers little in the way of extras. They simply get the job done.\n\n\n'''Beach Lounges'''\n\n\nThe beach lounge is a step up from the traditional folding beach chair, giving you a little extra comfort and relaxation on the [[beach lounges]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.beach-lounges.beach-recliner/]. Most models allow you to recline to several preset positions, which can be easily changed to meet your needs. Not all models have the ability to lie completely horizontal, but certain ones can.\n\n\n'''Beach Chairs with Foot Rest'''\n\n\nThe reclining premium beach chairs offers the reclining comfort of the beach lounge, but with ease and portability of the traditional high beach chair. This seat is equipped with a footrest that rises to support your feet. The fabric of these chairs also tends to be more breathable and comfortable.

Some chaises have a fixed recline position that cannot be changed. Most have several preset recline positions, but if you are looking to lie flat, you will need to specifically make sure it has that ability.\nThe Adirondack chair is perfect for any outdoor setting and can be left outside for prolonged periods of time in any climate, year round. These chairs, like the beach chaises, are heavy and difficult to transport, making them less ideal if you are looking for something that will be ready for an on-the-go lifestyle.  However, they offer great weather resistance that needs little maintenance and will last for years.  \n\n\nIf you love the look of the wooden beach chaise, but are looking for something lightweight and more portable, then look no further than the wooden beach chair with reclining feature. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. This option offers a classy wooden frame and a comfortable seat. It can also recline to several preset levels, to meet your needs.\n\n\n'''Backpack Chairs'''\n\n\nThe backpack chairs are the ultimate creation that combines lightweight and portability that makes transporting this backpack beach chair a cinch. It easily folds up and fits snugly into its carrying case, which you can toss over your shoulder while you stroll around. It is a great alternative to traditional [[folding beach chairs]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.heavy-beach-chairs/]  \n\n\n'''Canopy Beach Chairs'''\n\n\nNo matter if you are looking for a chair to carry with you all day, or a chair that will stay put in the heaviest rain storms, there is a beach chair that can be founds to meet your individual needs.\nOther options include the [[canopy beach chair]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.canopy-beach-chair/] and the layflat beach chairs. The former is a great alternative to a beach umbrella if you don't want the hassle of carrying something extra but still would like some sun protection. The latter is self-explanatory and is more comfortable than laying flat in the sand to work on that tan.\n"

If you are looking to fit many people in your sun shelter, then you may want to consider a large [[beach cabana]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.beach-cabana/], a large family tent, or a large beach gazebo. Dome tents, pop-up beach tents, and frame tents all provide a space that is smaller and designed with a single family in mind.\n\n'''Pop-up Beach Shelters:'''\n\nThey are by far the easiest to set up, but are a little more difficult to take down.

There is no privacy with [[beach canopy]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/buyer_guides.beach-tents/], and they are prone to damage under high winds. But they provide excellent shelter for your family and friends while on the beach.\n\n'''Privacy:'''\n\nIf you are looking for privacy, then it is very important that you find a tent that will allow all four sides to be completely enclosed. Some beach sun tent comes with mesh windows to allow breeze through the [[beach cabanas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/buyer_guides.beach-tents/] to help protect you from getting too hot. Therefore it is important that the windows have zip-up coverings.\n \n'''Storage:'''\n\nStorage can also be very useful in a shelter for the beach.

      "description" : "== Buying Guide for Beach Hammocks ==\n\n\n=Highly Suitable for Rest and Relaxation=\n\n\nHammocks are essentially a bed made of fabric that is primarily attached to two different points like trees or wooden stands and leave it suspended like a swing. These were traditionally used by the Navy sailors as the sleeping bed. However, over the years, people have started carrying these hammocks to suit several outdoor relaxation spots like on a beach, poolside, into the woods, camping or any other such places that people tend to go to unwind themselves. \n\n\nNowadays, [[beach hammocks]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair/] are increasingly being used by more and more people as these are just perfect for beachside relaxation. These hammocks are available in variety of styles, fabrics and designs that tend to provide people with ample choice to choose from. \n\n\n\n\nUsually a hammock is designed to carry the weight of a single person. However, nowadays, owing to their growing demand and popularity among people, these hammocks have started being designed in such a manner so as to accommodate two to three people in the same hammock. The ideal weight range for such hammocks would be approximately 400 lbs to 600 lbs. the basic dimensions or measurements of beach hammocks would be approximately 6 to 11 foot long and 3 to 14 foot wide. \n\n\n\n\nBeach hammocks are just perfect for the beach day out as people can easily hang these using any two sturdy points. People can then lie down on the hammock and relax by reading a book, chilling out with a cool drink or simply taking a short nap in order to get some rest. People can also share beach hammocks with their friend or partner and simply spend some quality time with each other. Beach hammocks comprise of mosquito netting that effectively helps in get rid of various irritable insects that tend to bother people on several such outdoor locations. Beach hammocks are made from materials that are extremely light in weight thereby enabling people to easily carry them on their outings. Some may even come with few storage pockets in order to enable one to use that space for carrying important essentials that they may require on such occasions.  \n\n\n\n\n'''Hammocks are available in varied styles and designs'''\n\n\n\n\n'''Brazilian Hammocks'''\nOne of the most common types of hammocks that are exclusively used under cold climatic conditions is the Brazilian hammock. These are hand made hammocks that are essentially made from the cotton fabrics. These hammocks offer great quality, strength and exceptional durability. One may also find self supporting hammocks that need no point of attachment. These are commonly used for the backyard; however, these can also be carried on a beach if one wishes to. There my be various hammocks that are made from the parachute silk fabric as this material is resistant to weather conditions thereby making them perfect for an outdoor location. \n\n\n'''Mayan style hammocks'''\nMayan style hammocks are the most beautifully designed that are available in varied stunning colors. Some of the hammocks may also come with essential accessories like side tables, storage bags and pillows. \n\n\nBeach hammocks therefore offer value for money as people tend to experience deep relaxation and rejuvenation experience.\n\n\n= Hang a hammock where there are no supports=\n\n\nThe discovery of hammock can be attributed to the people who lived in the tropical area. They had to raise themselves from the ground to escape from insects and snake bite. People started to make sleeping arrangements by tying some kind of strong chords across trees. Later it began to be used by travelers, explorers and on boats. It is a convenient way to sleep safely and is useful when there is less of space. It just needs two strong supports to hang it up. It later came into use as a symbol for relaxation. Slowly different variations came because of evolution. There are hammocks designed as a chair which allow a person to relax in the same way as on a normal one. The next step was to bring about a stand so that it can be hung any where one feels like. There is no binding of looking for proper supports. The comfort and convenience is making it more and more popular.  \n\n\n\n\nThe best way to have a relaxed day at home on the porch or at a camping site is by sitting in a hammock which is designed to feel like a chair. Buying the right hammock may not look like the most important task yet it has to be treated with some interest. A hammock is nothing but a hanging bed from two points or four points. It can be made of fabric or of ropes woven together. The ropes can be of nylon, cotton, canvas or jute. The net made can be so close that it even looks like a fabric. The nets made can be hung from trees or other supports like poles or stands. To suspend these nets clews or cords are used. They come in different sizes and shapes for children and adults.  The cords of the hammock are passed through a spreader at both ends to give it a shape.  There are some which can be hung on a beach. It should have supports like trees to tie both the ends. Where there are no such facilities, there are stands that can be carried for the purpose. The 'C' shapes stand is meant for a hammock chair. There are many hammock chairs which come in combination with a stand. Some of them can be folded. The stands are made of metals and powder coated steel. The fabric swing beds come in different colors. They are weather proof and do not lose their color so easily.  There are also the quilted ones in the fabric category. The fabric made swing beds do not tilt so easily. It is very safe for the use of children. They can be allowed to use one of their own. There are some which can fit two people at a time. Kids can have a great time on a lovely summer afternoon on the porch or on a beach.\n\n\n\n\nThere are famous beaches which are known as hammock beaches. They have many trees on the beaches which can be used for the purpose of hanging a chair or hammock.\n"

      "description" : "[[Patio umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/]\n add a touch of class and color to your lawn, deck or any outdoor patio setting. These umbrellas not only provide shade, but also block out the sun's glare and its damaging and harmful UV rays.\n\n'''How to Purchase Market & Patio Umbrellas'''\n\nPatio umbrellas differ from regular umbrellas and sometimes referred to as [[garden umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/buyer_guides.outdoor-umbrellas/].  So one should consider various features before opting for them. \n\n'''Shade Area:''' \nMeasure the length and the width of the outdoor shade area; allow about six to eight inches from around the umbrella for clearance outside the umbrella canopy. This allows the patio umbrella to open and close without obstruction. E.g. 8 x 8 ft balcony will allow a patio umbrella with 7 foot diameter to cover 30 inch table. For larger Area of 10 x 10 ft, [[Offset patio umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.patio-umbrella.offset-umbrellas/] are recommended to cover large tables of 48 inches and mixed seating space. \n\n'''Canopy Fabric:'''\nPatio umbrella fabric comes in many colors and patterns. Breathable fabrics are a good choice; they stay cool under the hot sun. Most umbrella fabrics are colorfast, mildew and mold resistant. If you store the umbrella away during the winter or rainy periods - then a thinner, less expensive fabric might do, such as polyester. Otherwise, a more durable fabric such as sunbrella for umbrella which is going to stay outside in the rain or be full time in the hot summer sun. Keep in mind that umbrella coverings with darker colors and thicker fabrics will have better UV protection.\n\n'''Quality Frame:''' \nOutdoor umbrellas are most likely to be abused or misused. They must have a sturdy frame to withstand windy conditions. Good quality umbrellas have wind vents at the top, which facilitate air circulation. Most frames are made from wood, fiberglass or metal. Metal (Aluminum or Steel) and fiberglass patio umbrella frames have a lot of features and can blend with almost all patio settings. For Commercial Patio Umbrellas or high traffic areas, we recommended patio umbrellas with the least moving parts like single pole or strong couplings, manual or pulley lift. Helpful information about the pieces and parts of the \"skeleton\" of patio umbrella:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Crank:'''\nA device that is rotated to open and close the canopy. Some have the tilt-mechanism built-in the crank to make tilting the canopy easy. Crank types are \"NOT\" recommended for use in commercial applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Pulley & Pin:'''\nMany aluminum patio umbrellas have cranks as a mechanism to raise and lower the canopy, most wood styles have a push up mechanism or pulley & pin type to adjust it to the proper height. A simple manual push up type of operation with pin & hole option to keep the shade open is recommended for commercial settings. Some market umbrellas use the pulley system that requires more effort but recommend for wider umbrellas over 9 foot diameter.\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Pole:'''\nMost poles are assembled in two pieces for easy transport and storage. They measure 1.375 inches to 2 inches in diameter. The most common pole materials are wood or aluminum. A single solid pole adds considerable strength to help them better withstand wind pressure and the rigors of outdoor commercial applications around hotel & apartment pool areas, or restaurant settings.\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Ribs:'''\nThese are the arms of your frame that spread and support the canopy into the open position. More ribs provide added strength and stability. The Fiberglass ribs are lightweight and outstanding at absorbing wind gusts without breaking and last four times longer than wood or aluminum ribs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n'''Warranty:''' \nBuy market and patio umbrellas that carry a warranty. Sunbrella Fabric has three year warranty against fading unlike one year warranty for Olefin. Polyester fabric generally has no warranty.\n\n'''Resistant:''' \nMarket & patio umbrellas with Mold, Mildew, stain and water resistant lasts longer and easy to clean.\n\n'''Sun-Resistant:''' \nMarket & patio umbrellas which have UV treated fabrics are more durable so it resists tearing, cracking or splitting. Umbrella coverings with darker colors and thicker fabrics have better UV protection\n\n'''Wind Vent:''' \nIt's a flap in the fabric of canopy that allows for wind and heat to escape the top of the umbrella. It provides added stability during windy conditions and comfort by allowing hot air to escape from the top and makes it feel cooler under the shade. \n\n'''Tilt Mechanism:''' \nTilt or crank features is not recommended in a commercial application Many residential style umbrellas have tilt options:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Crank / Auto Tilt:'''\nLocated on, at, or near the crank of the umbrella, allows you to continue cranking after the umbrella is open in order to achieve the desired shade.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Push Button Tilt:'''\nLocated at the top of the pole just below ribs. You release the spring loaded button, and it locks the umbrella tilting lever to the position. Usually Patio Umbrellas comes in 3 tilt positions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n'''Collar Tilt:'''\nThis option is one of the quickest and most popular not requiring much effort and adjusts to almost infinite positions utilizing the convenient tilt mechanism whilst seated.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n[[Umbrella Stand]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/]: This makes umbrellas sturdier, especially during strong winds. The proper weight for your umbrella base or stand is determined by the size of your umbrella and whether it is being utilized through a table or freestanding. A table can add weight to help hold down your umbrella on the ground. A freestanding umbrella requires a considerably heavier [[umbrella base]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/].\n\n'''Color Scheme:''' \nConsider the color scheme of your outdoor furniture when buying a [[market umbrella]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/]. If you have a neutral color scheme, you could choose brightly colored umbrellas.\n\n'''Cleaning, Care, and Storage:''' \nBegin by using a damp cloth to wipe away any dust or dirt. To remove tougher soiling, use soapy water before wiping down with a clean cloth. Avoid using chemicals, abrasive materials, or other harsh cleaning products, as these may cause undue damage to your patio umbrella. Regular cleaning is recommended to keep your patio umbrella looking like new and performing well. Make sure you store your umbrella in a dry place when not in use. Mildew and mold will be sure to build up in the folds of the umbrella if you store it in a damp place. If the chance for inclement weather is high, we recommend closing the shade of your patio umbrella or storing it in a sheltered area if possible. \n\n'''Types of Umbrellas:'''\n\nWe offer numerous types of [[market and patio umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/] to choose from. \n\n[[Offset Patio Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.patio-umbrella.offset-umbrellas/]: More versatile choice than normal freestanding umbrellas. It features cantilever designs with an offset umbrella base and a shade that extends over the desired area. Offset patio umbrellasis is a better choice for seating areas where you don't want obstruction. \n\nFreestanding outdoor umbrellas: These are standard patio umbrella styles with pole that extends up to the center of the shade and down to the umbrella stand. These are a reliable choice for normal shade and preferred option for patio tables with umbrella holes. These umbrellas are more portable than offset type which are heavier and require weighted slabs to secure their bases on the ground. \n"

      "description" : "=Choosing the Right Picnic Supplies=\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the size of the picnic, picnic baskets are a must! Picnic baskets show up in different sizes and people may opt for one that suits their respective needs. The importance of [[picnic baskets]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-baskets/] needs no detailed explanation since it is a common fact that these are used to stockpile essential picnic accessories, eateries and other picnic supplies.\n\n\n\n\nPicnic baskets are by far the most important picnic accessory. While selecting a picnic basket a person must bear in mind that functionality of the basket is far more important than its visual appeal. The basket should be spacious enough to hold quite a lot of picnic accessories. Some backpacks and baskets also provide compartments to store picnic blankets and mats. Then there are others that provide special separate compartments to stock delicate items like wine glasses, crockery, cutlery etc. Although picnic baskets weigh little but a person may still consider going in for wheeled baskets. They undoubtedly allow far more easy movement. Backpacks are also very easy to carry. Willow baskets have a timeless appeal. Hand woven baskets look pleasant and cute. These days however, picnic baskets come in a wide range of fabrics. These picnic baskets and backpacks are not only functional but elegant as well. Some of them come with elaborate designing and finishing.\n\n\n\n\nPicnic coolers are especially required when the picnic spot is at a considerable distance from one's place. In that case, a person would wish that the drinks remain chilled all along the picnic. Picnic coolers help to solve this major problem. What's more? These coolers are handy and being lightweight they can be easily transported from one place to another. Coolers also help to keep the eatables fresh. There are specific foods that turn sour on even the slightest change in temperature. Some coolers come with special ice chests to store beer etc. An ice chest can add to the weight of the cooler but otherwise almost all picnic coolers are lightweight.\n\n\n\n\nAnother important picnic accessory is picnic blankets. Generally all picnic mats come with a waterproof bottom. Again the size of the mat or the blanket depends on the size of the family which is out for a picnic. A mat provides more comfort than standard picnic chairs since it allows a person to lie down after a hectic day at the beach.\n\n\n\n\nPicnic umbrellas are equally important. Unless the family finds some shade to sit and relax, picnic umbrellas are extremely essential. Hammocks and loungers are another important picnic accessory. Luxury picnic supplies include barbeque tool kits, portable grills, lavish baskets and backpacks, beach cabanas, etc.\nPicnicking can become all the more fun with the right picnic accessories. Another popular item is [[backpack chair]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/WRB5370/] with built-in insulated coller and storage pouch.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the precise supplies can add up to the picnic adventure. It has been stressed above as well but it still demands repetition- Utility of the picnic supplies is foremost. Style and design are important but these considerations are secondary. There are numerous marts (offline and online both) that offer all sorts of picnic equipment and essential outdoor supplies.\n"

Body boarding is a type of wave riding and to be able to do that one needs a [[bodyboard]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.bodyboards/]. Body boarding is a sport for the brave-hearted souls. It is for those who do not fear fighting strong and merciless waves. Some people are passionate about the sport and are backed by years of experience in the sport. Some however, are new to the sport. It is very important that beginners be a little careful as regards selecting the right body board and right way of going about the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\nBody boards are not new and also know as boogie boards in beach sports. They have been in existence since 1900s. Yes they have evolved over time quite a lot; initially they were made out of wood.\nNow if one is thinking as to where to body board, there are a plethora of options. There is no need to go searching for high tide ocean as these days almost all amusement parks offer body boarding. These amusement parks develop artificial high waves to provide for an equally thrilling experience of body boarding.\n\n\nA body board is a board of the size depending on the person's height. That is to say that body boards come in varied sizes. A person needs to choose one according to his/her height. There are body boards as huge as 50 inches; there are even those that are not even 30 inches. It is made from plastic and foam. Obviously, a body board has to be water resistant. Next, the shape of the board rather the tail of the board must be such that it allows riding on the waves easily and effortlessly. A novice must always go in for a board whose tail is inward-curving. Crescent shaped tails are the best and safest for beginners. Whatever size of body board one goes for, the body board must be such that it remains smooth and does not shake when put straight on a flat surface.\n\n\n\n\nThe decision as regards whether one wants to buy a body board or one wants to rent out one is purely subjective. These days however most people are fascinated by the idea of rented body boards to escape the hassle of purchasing one. Usually all amusement parks provide body boards on rent. A body boarding freak may not be convinced of the idea but it is really a great idea to go for rented body boards in case of once-in-a-while body boarders. Still it is important that a novice consults an expert present at the park as regards to which body board to go in for. A wrong body board may play havoc since body boarding is a challenging sport and one cannot afford to be negligent at any cost and at any time.\n\n\n\n\nBody boards come in a variety of designs and patterns. Some are floral, some have aquatic themes on them, some are plain and some use a whole spectrum of colors in them. All in all, a person has enough room to make a choice.\n\n\n\n\nAnother recreation beach sports is skimming on the beach sand with [[skimboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.skimboards/].\n"

      "description" : "= Beach and Picnic Blankets =\n\n\nPicnics mean lot of fun with family or friends. The very thought of heading out for a picnic spells happiness and relief. The lush green garden together with the company of loved ones or a beach picnic with one's beloved over a glass of wine is a truly refreshing break from the monotony of daily routine. Once decided, one will have to jot down a list of things he/she would need. Besides some obvious things like snacks, cookies, wine and water, one would need a picnic blanket or beach blanket.\n\n\n\n\n'''Designs and Sizes'''\n\n\nBeach and picnic blankets come in varied designs and sizes. If one is going for a picnic with the whole army, there are large blankets. One the other hand, if only two lovers are planning to go, there are smaller versions. Also, they come in different weights. The apparent disadvantage of the heavier ones is that they are bulky and somewhat embarrassing to carry and move around with. Today there is a diverse range of compact and light blankets available. Sunshine waterproof [[beach blankets]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.beach-blanket/] are easy to carry as they fold themselves into a very thin layer and fit into the backpack easily. Let the burden of the blanket not damper the spirit of the party. Some of the picnic blanket are designed with matching [[pinic coolers]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-cooler/] and backpacks. \n\n\n\n\n'''Features:'''\nAnother important consideration while choosing beach and picnic blankets is whether they are waterproof or not. It is advisable that one goes in for waterproof ones. There are two aspects to it. Firstly, one would not have to worry about any spillage. With children around, this comes as a very common feature. Even with adults, one cannot be sure of any non-spoilage. Secondly, the blanket should not be such that allows the moisture in the ground to penetrate to the above surface. A ground hog oversized waterproof blanket serves both the purposes. The base side of such a blanket is made from a strong fabric like nylon and the upper surface is usually polyester, cotton or acrylic in stuff. \n\n\n\n\nWhen the lovers decide to hit the beach or any other garden for that matter, beach and picnic blankets can actually set the tone and mood of the picnic. The couple may decide to go in for one that comes with nice lace and ribbons all over. The color and texture of the blanket also goes a long way in the mood of the party right.\n\n\n\n\nPicnics are a time to make fun and shed all the accumulated fatigue and monotony. One may want to bask in the sun or just stretch out for a while in the fresh air or maybe laze around on the blanket. Enjoy your relaxation under under the sun with beach umbrella. The blanket therefore must be comfortable enough. Another thing one just cannot miss out on when making the purchase is the durability. Please do not go for inferior quality beach and picnic blankets for the sake of them being cheap. The strength of the blanket should be foremost.\n\n\n\n\nSome beach and picnic blankets come with extra padding to ensure long-lasting comfort. People dealing with the problem of lower back pain usually go in for blankets as these. Happy picnicking!\n"

Contemplating the revival of the fashion trends of the 80's, there has been great interest for people in bright neon colors. Eventually, colors play an important role while designing clothing for kids. Most of the designers use the shades that look great on children, sometimes pairing with less abrasive tones, while some are fashioned with single induced blocks. Enchantingly, these high beamed colors have made their way with some prints that were used in 50's. The perfect blend of prints and colors keeps the looks fresh and updates the most modern and cute deigns such as gingham and applique accents.

By merging these two elements in the same clothing, it allows one to dominate the aesthetic appeal, with the other showcasing details in color scheme.

      "description" : "=Umbrella Stands and Umbrella Bases can be very crucial for an umbrella=\n\nAn umbrella will be of no use if it is not able to stand erect and give shade to the people sitting under it. The standing umbrellas are preferred over the ones that are held in hand because one does not have to care about the umbrella and can sit freely under the [[umbrella stands]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/] without having to hold it or give it support. If the umbrella that is supposed to stand erect in the ground is not able to do so and keeps falling here and there then there is no point having such an umbrella. For any umbrella it is very important that it has a good and sturdy umbrella stand and umbrella base.\nThe beach umbrellas are to be fixed in the loose sand and this can be a very difficult task if the umbrella does not have a strong base. The base should be strong that an umbrella is not blown away by wind or not made to fall off by splashing rain showers. A properly fastened umbrella can make the time spent under it more enjoyable and an umbrella which is not fastened to the ground properly can spoil all the fun. There are only two main types of accessories that are very important for any umbrella. These two are, one is the sand anchor and the second is umbrella base.\n\nBoth the umbrella base and the sand anchor should be bought based upon the area where the umbrella is to be put up and the weather conditions and other circumstances of the area. The sand anchors are also known as sand augers. These are very important for those umbrellas especially which are put up in sand. These anchors have large spiral threads at the bottom which goes into the sand. It helps the umbrellas stand erect in front of even the fierce of winds. An umbrella without a [[sand anchor]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/WCOP055/] is almost useless. The second very important accessory is the umbrella base. An umbrella base is a disc like flat structure which is placed on the ground. It has a pole like structure protruding out from the middle of the disc. The [[patio umbrella base]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.galtech-umbrellas/] can be very easily be fixed in this pole with the help of a knob that is provided along. \n\nThese are very necessary especially to support patio umbrellas. The umbrella base should be very string and robust because the whole of the umbrella stands on it and if the base will be weak the umbrella will also surely fall off. These bases are available in many different types of materials like aluminum, cast iron, plastic, fiberglass, steel and even cement for umbrellas that are to be put up permanently.\n\nThe umbrella bases made out of plastic or fiberglass are generally used for patio umbrellas which are placed in open air spaces. The best part of these bases is that they do not damage the floor and still provide good shelter from the sun and rain.\n\nUmbrella Base & Stand Sizing Chart for Patio / Market Umbrellas:\n\n|=Shade Width (ft)|=  Positioning  |=  MINIMUM Base Size (lbs) \n|   4.5  |   Through Table   |  30  | \n|   4.5  |   Free Standing   |  40  |\n|   6    |   Through Table   |  30  |\n| 6 | Free Standing| 50 |\n|7.5 | Through Table| 30|\n|7.5 | Free Standing | 50 |\n| 8 or 8 x 10| Through Table| 50 |\n| 8 or 8 x 10| Free Standing| 75| \n| 9| Through Table | 50|\n|9| Free Standing| 75|\n|6.5 x 10| Through Table| 50|\n|6.5 x 10| Free Standing| 75|\n|11| Through Table| 50|\n|11|Free Standing| 75 |\n "

With more than 50 years of experience, Lafuma has designed their RSX XL recliner specifically for comfort to provide your body with the reprieve it needs from the harshness of everyday life.\n\n\n\n\nDesigned specifically to reduce strain on the lower back, this [[Lafuma chair]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.lafuma-recliner/] can be set to one of many, typically four, different positions to suit your individual tastes. Some chairs offer a zero gravity position, which takes the strain off of the lower regions of the back, thus reducing pain and discomfort. If you prefer, get one with an adjustable, built-in headrest for added comfort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lafuma chair also been designed for strength, as well as easy packing and transportation. The Lafuma lounger is designed from the ground up to be strong and light. The [[Lafuma recliner]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] is made with a steel and aluminum alloy. This not only makes the chair very strong, but it also makes it very light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing is more important than the comfort, support, and strength of the fabric in the Lafuma lounger. And because comfort is king, all of the [[Lafuma chairs]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.lafuma-recliner.lafuma-chairs/] are made with the most ventilating materials, in order to maintain your physical comfort. Also, all of these chairs are made with UV and weather resistant materials (like rust-resistant aluminum), so you will be assured of their safe and proper functioning far into the future. A nice benefit in their current design, is that the fabric is customizable. It is completely removable and can even be changed with other fabrics, designs, or prints. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few options and styles available, tailored to meet your needs, both in the chair and in the pocketbook. Mesh, polyester, and poly-cotton canvas are a few of the choices available for these beach chaises. Of these choices, the padded poly-cotton RSX recliner stuffed with high-density foam is the most luxuriant model and provides superior comfort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common problem that I notice with many folding beach chairs, is that after I have reclined, I have nowhere to put my arms, causing me to either fold my arms across my chest, let them hang, or just try and hang onto the arm rests. However, this is a problem that this chair has been designed to solve. The armrests recline with the rest of the chair. So, once you find a comfortable position, you will not need to readjust if you recline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLafuma's zero-gravity lounge chair is pretty awesome too. The [[Lafuma RSX XL Recliner]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chair.beach-lounges.beach-recliner/] is extra wide because sometimes it is just nice to have a lot of space. You can recline as little or as much as you want in it. It is super comfortable, and the cup holders are a nice touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter if you are looking for a simple reclining aluminum beach chair or a padded recliner with all of the bell and whistles, I would suggest that you look no further than the Lafuma Cham Elips or the Lafuma RSX XL recliners. They are sure to make you feel like you are sitting in the lap of luxury. And with a two-year warranty, they are sure to give you many days of happy sitting.\n"

Quality products made by Lafuma Recliners are known for good workmanship.\n\n\n'''Care and Maintenance'''\n\n\nIn order to make sure that beach loungers last for a longer period of time, effective care should be taken thereby ensuring enhanced durability of the lounger. People should preferably avoid using various detergents, bleaching solutions and other soap chemicals as these may adversely affect the fabric of the lounger. Beach loungers should be hand washed rather than machine wash in order to ensure that no harsh cleaning operations ruin the material thereof. The hot water can hamper the quality of lounger; it is therefore feasible to use water with normal temperature thereby restoring the durability and quality of the lounger. The dust on a beach lounger must be brushed off regularly in order to avoid unwanted collection of dirt. The ironing of the lounger should be strictly prohibited as it can damage the material and fabric tremendously. \n\n\n''' Varities and Styles'''\n\n\nBeach loungers are widely available in various colors that can be used in multiple combinations in order to give an appealing look that instantly catches attention. Blue, turquoise, red, green, pink and yellow are some of the most preferred colors when it comes to designing a beach lounger or Beach Chaise. The wooden arm rests, cushioned head rest and detachable foot rests tend to ensure enhanced comfort level that provides utmost relaxation and soothing experience. A lounger is extremely light in weight which essentially comes with an adjustable shoulder strap thereby making it all the more easy for people to carry it. \n\n\nBeach loungers are therefore extremely viable owing to their feasibility and practicality thereby offering great utility to the beach lovers. \n"

      "description" : "=Beach Bags and Beach Totes Buying Guide=\n\nBeach bags and totes come in a plethora of options. The one for you depends on what you plan to use it for, as well as your own personal taste and style. No matter which you chose, be sure to get one that is water resistant or better yet, waterproof. You also might want to choose a [[beach bag]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.beach-bags-totes/] or beach tote of a bright color so that it is easy to spot on a crowded beach when you are returning to your area from a dip in the ocean.\n\n\nIf you carry a purse, you're already ahead of the game. Think of your favorite purse, the one you use most days. You will probably want to purchase a similar style for the beach. For example, if you have an oversized purse, your beach bags of choice will likely be quite large. Be sure to purchase one large enough to accommodate your daily necessities, as well as everything you need for a fun day at the beach.\n\nIf a purse is not your style (or if you're a typical man), consider a beach backpack in lieu of the traditional beach bag. Again, be sure you purchase one that is the right size to accommodate most of your beach gear what you plan to take to the beach. Your backpack should have comfortable, padded straps and be waterproof. A good quality backpack will be made of rip-stop material like nylon. Consider getting a backpack with multiple outside compartments to keep smaller items handy and easier to find.\n\n \nA mesh beach tote is another option. The mesh allows air to circulate and keep your clothes and towels dry in the [[beach totes]:http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.beach-bags-totes/].\nNo day at the beach is complete without food. A picnic tote is the perfect way to transport your food from the car to the sand. Picnic totes come in many varieties, including picnic baskets, rolling coolers, and picnic backpacks.\nWhen searching for that perfect picnic tote, be sure to look for one with the following qualities:\n'''Good insulation:'' \nThis will keep your food from spoiling in the sun before you can enjoy it.\n'''Easy-to-clean Fabric:'' \nIt will make your clean up time much faster when you get home.\n'''Multiple compartments:'' \nPicnic totes without compartments aren't conducive to keeping certain food items (like sandwiches or chips) from getting smashed.\n'''Fair price:'' \nA good picnic tote costs around $35 minimum. Anything below that, and you should careful consider its quality. (Of course, larger totes with more features will cost more.) Just remember that you get what you pay for; you need something that will stand up against the harsh sun and protect your food and beverages.\n\nIf the distance between your car and your spot on the beach isn't very far, typical picnic totes or picnic baskets should work just fine for you. However, if you have a lot to carry (your beach bag, a beach blanket, towels, beach chairs, etc.), it might be a good idea to get a Beach Cart for easy transportation of your gear. Be sure to get beach / picnic  cooler that is waterproof, especially if you plan to use fill it with ice.\nThe other option for a more lengthy walk on the beach is the picnic backpack to go hands free. A good one can actually serve a dual purpose: beach bag and picnic tote.\n"

Kids yearn for that part of the day when they will get to wear their favorite swimsuits. There is a whole big industry that is engaged in manufacturing [[kids swimwear]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear.kids-swimsuit/]. Nowadays, kids swimwear comes in exciting colors, shapes, patterns and sizes. Swimwear for children is especially made out from quality fabrics like nylon and Lycra in order to avoid rubbing, chaffing and irritation. Childrenâs skin is highly sensitive and special efforts are made at the manufacturing stage to ensure bodily comfort.\n\n\nNylon and spandex also serve as high quality swimwear fabrics. These materials have low water absorption and quick drying capacity. These two fabrics are especially known to provide added comfort and also help a great deal to improve one's speed in water. The material is comfortable and highly stretchable to accommodate varying body sizes.\nThere are ample color choices for kids to pick from. Furthermore, there are attractive patterns and childlike designs that enhance the vibrancy of the material. Children look cute and adorable in these bright swimsuits. It is very important that the swimsuit fits well so that kids can relax and enjoy at the pool. The swimsuit should neither be too tight nor too loose. All in all, the fabric of the swimwear should allow the child's body to breathe.\nThere are wetsuits made from neoprene, a thicker fabric which permits a great flexibility, while maintaining the body temperature. Wetsuits offer protection and warmth to children when they are playing in water. These are available in varied sizes. Most swimsuits and wet suit fabrics offer up to 97% protection from ultraviolet rays of the sun. Swimsuits and wet suits come in different patterns and designs depending on the sport or activity one is engaged in. Full wetsuits are more appropriate for diving, snorkeling and other deep-water sports while the short designs are appropriate for activities like surfing and swimming. Since children are vulnerable to cold weather, swimsuits should come with wrappers and towels to keep them warm once they are out of water. A good swimwear should essentially be trendy and functional.\n\n\nIt does not end here. There are numerous swimming accessories that are attracting today's kids. There is a whole range of goggles, head gear, swimming nappies, floral sandals, hats and other pool accessories. Our wide selection of [[Board shorts]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear.board-shorts/], [[Rashguards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear.rashguard/], and other [[BeachWear]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear.beach-wear/]\n\n\nBecause of hygiene concerns it is also very important to have backup swimsuits every time one goes to the pool or the beach. Germs and bacteria can grow rather quickly on wet swimwear. The specialists advocate having two swimsuits because if children wear wet swimsuit for a long period of time, they may get infections and rashes. Sometimes the infection may develop into a much serious ailment. The experts also recommend that kids' swimsuits should not be shared with other childre\n"

One needs a body board or a surfing board to enjoy this sport.  Bodyboarding   is kind of riding over a wave some times known as boogie riding too. A smaller board is used for it which is rectangular and hydrodynamic. It is typically ridden in a prone position.  [[Body boards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.bodyboards/] are used for surfing while lying and not in a standing posture. The body board is shorter than the surfing board and is made of foam with a plastic bottom. They are broader than a surfing board. To choose the correct size of the board place the tail portion on the floor and hold the board in an up right position, the nose should be around the navel of the user. The flex and the control provided to the rider differ with the foam used in the board. The boards have one or two of graphite or of carbon to give them strength and reduce deformation and to add stiffness. These rods are called the stringers. The modern boards have channels which can increase the surface area resulting in a better wave hold. The skegs, tails are used according to the kind of riding that one would do. There are basically two types of bonding the upper deck and the bottom. The shape of the board makes a lot of difference in the kind of riding that can be done. If the broad face is nearer to the nose it would be good for prone riding. A buyer should have a fair idea about the performance of the board depending on the shape.\n\n\nThere are many companies which make body boards. Body boards made by Morey are the most popular brand in the whole world. Morey's bodyboards come in different sizes to suit people of different height and weight. Morey boards can be selected on the bases of the core, tail, size and the stringer. They come in different colors. \n\n\nWhile buying a [[bodyboard]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/buyer_guides.bodyboards-body-board/], make sure that the surface is not porous. They tend to get heavy in water within a short time. The surface should have a smooth finish. When the board is laid on the ground it should not wobble or rock back and forth. While testing for the flex hold the rear of the board against the stomach and try to flex it by holding the nose. The better it flexes the better its performance would be. The more flexible boards get spoiled quickly. The tails of the board include the latest technology which comes into the market. It is better to know of it from an attendant. Also make sure that the foam of the board selected has no cracks or creases. Such boards can be life threatening. \n\n\nAll the accessories required by the body boarders are also on hand. There are various categories among body boarding like Prone, drop knee, girl or a big guy. They are different styles of riding. Buy the correct board for a particular style and beat the wave and enjoy the fun with popular [[beach sports]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.skimboards/]\n"

The mechanism essentially allows a person to relax and elevate at 'zero gravity' position. This helps the people to relieve the vertebrae strain. These zero gravity recliners help a person to sit in an upright position thereby stimulating blood circulation. These relaxing recliners are highly beneficial for all people but they are of special utility to those who suffer from backaches and other spinal disorders. The chairs are positioned and built in such a manner that they allow people to extend their legs above their heart. This further helps to reduce muscle tension, spine pressure and unnecessary heaviness on the heart. Instead it boosts oxygen circulation and helps to expand lung capacity.\n\n\nZero gravity recliners come in varied sizes, styles and designs. There is a whole collection ranging from small sized recliners to huge upholstered recliners. Experts hold that stretching out on these zero gravity recliners can actually combat severe back pains. The adjustable neck and headrest allows extended comfort. The popularity of these zero gravity recliners has led the manufacturers to incorporate the fundamental zero gravity mechanism into beds and lounges as well.\n\n\n=Styles and Designs=\n\n'''[[Lafuma RSX Recliner]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/WLF122662/]'''\nmakes use of the company's patented zero gravity system.

Since then, picnics have indeed come a long way, though the basic purpose of relaxing around with the family remains the same.\nPicnic backpacks are a must for any excursion. The very thought of a picnic backpack leads the brain to vision a basket full of nice and yummy food to eat and rich wine to relish. The traditional [[picnic backpacks]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-backpack/] have evolved into all the more beautiful and comfortable picnic baskets. The present day picnic backpacks come with several different compartments in order to accommodate more things. There are separate chambers for fresh food, cutlery, beverages, napkins and other such things of use. Also some chambers have the insulating power which allows hot food to be kept hot and cold to be kept cold.\n\n\n\n\n'''Styles and Colors'''\n\n\n\n\nPicnic backpacks come in different styles and colors. One can choose as per one's choice and requirement. The very fundamental picnic backpacks consist of a picnic cooler to save the food and drinks from any kind of spoilage. They are made from an insulating fabric. They are usually waterproof to account for any spillage.\n\n\n\n\nIn a more refined form, picnic backpacks offer some additional compartments. They contain various pockets to heed to various picnic needs. On the outside, they are generally not very appealing. For those who want a picnic backpack which is trendy and chic, unfortunately these may not work though they do serve the basic purpose of a backpack. They are somewhat cumbersome and one would not want to carry the burden of a bulky backpack on a picnic. This would spoil the whole feel of being at the picnic.\nThere is no need to get disappointed. Not all picnic backpacks are ugly on the frontal. Some are alluring and truly fabulous. While some follow the traditional style of a cane picnic basket with lots of embellishment, there are others in the form of bags. One may select one that appeals to him.\nThese days the market is flooded with a variety of picnic backpacks for children. They are glossy and appealing on the exterior. Most come with cartoon characters embedded on them. They are absolutely cute and irresistible. It will not be a bad idea to get the child his own backpack. This would give him an independent feel, plus it would the hassles on the part of parents.\n\n\n\n\nSo basically it is a personal decision and will depend from person to person. When the number of people at a picnic is to be large, one would obviously need a pretty roomy one. Similarly, if only a few people decide to head for the beach or elsewhere to spend some quality time with family and friends, even a smaller backpack would solve the purpose.\nPlus picnic backpacks make for great presents. They look unique and cute and the receiver is sure to admire the thought.\n\n\n\n\nWith all these features in mind, it is time to hit the market to select one that suits all the needs.\n"

They are also known as shade structures. They are portable and are easy to construct, fold and unfold. Small children love these private beach centers. The two terms- cabanas and tents are by and large used to denote the same thing and are hence used interchangeably.\n\n\nEarlier only a selected few [[beach tents]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.beach-tent-shelters/] were equipped with an SPF protection but of late nearly all gazebos, cabanas and tents come with adequate UV protection. The actual sun protection factor may vary from one tent to another but almost all of them are essentially equipped with at least some fraction of it.\nFrom simple tents to luxurious cabanas, beach shade structures come in a variety of sizes, designs and features. The chief types of beach tents are explained in the following lines:\n\n\n'''Family Tents: '''\nAs the name suggests, family tents are made with the thought to accommodate the entire family and hence are particularly large in size. They are usually big enough to house 5-6 people. They can even accommodate beach equipment like chairs and beach umbrellas.\n\n\n'''Kids Tents: '''\nChildren cabanas are extremely cute beach structures. They come in striking colors and designs.\n\n\n'''Canopy Tents : '''\nBeach canopy tents are usually used to hold grand events like parties and weddings etc.\n\n\n'''Dome Tents : '''\nThese beach tents are extremely lightweight and portable. The dome shape makes them compact.\n\n\n'''Frame Tents : ''' \nThese are rather complex structures with elaborate steel poles and aluminum framing. These tents are however not very difficult to set up and can be easily positioned with the help of just 2 strong people.\n\n\n'''Pop-up Beach Tents : '''\nThese tents are one of the kinds of children beach tents only. They are extremely simple to set up. Popular pop up beach tent which provide shade for upto 4 people.\n\n\n'''Tripod : '''\nAs the name suggests tripods are triangular shaped tents. This form of tent provides great ventilation because of its shape.\n\n\nUsually a beach tent does not have any floor or door but some tents even come with detailed windows. Almost all beach tents include compartments to store essential beach equipment and other knick knacks for children. Some elaborate beach structures even include special compartments that can easily serve as changing rooms. The tent also allows the family to stretch out and unwind. This helps to ensure privacy. They serve as perfect isolated havens. Besides providing the much needed privacy compared to beach umbrella, the beach tents also help to protect the family from the brunt of merciless heat.\n\n\n\n\nIf somehow, a person does not want to invest in a beach tent, the option of hiring a beach tent may be considered. People who go for camping pretty frequently prefer to buy their own beach cabanas but for those who aren't that avid camping adventurers, hiring the beach tents is by far the best option. The trend of getting hold of a custom made tent is also catching up. Sunrays can beat a person down. Play smart, fight the heat and get hold of a beach tent soon!\n"

The word 'younger' implies that a skim board is a miniature version of a surfboard. Ordinary skimboards are approximately 40 inches in length. Skim boards lying around is a common scene at any beach. Skim boarding is fun. It is done in shallow water. The skim board is thrown into a shallow stretch of water. The rider then jumps on to the board and glides across the water. Standing atop the board, the rider goes about performing amazing water tricks and rare feats all along. \n\n\nMaestros in skim boarding perform nerve racking tricks like shuv-it, Ollie, spin, varials and more. The onlookers are flabbergasted at the amazing display of tricks. Human body gets such wonderfully mechanical at times! A novice will prefer to remain in shallow water all throughout but an expert in the beach sport will move into a little deeper stretch of water braving strong waves all along with skimboard. A beginner must never ever begin with ferocious skim boarding, whatsoever is the level of excitement!\n\n\nSkim boarding dates back to 1920 and it has come a long way since then. In earlier times, skim boards were circular in shape. Today skim boarding is commonplace. More and more people are gravitated towards the sport these days. Some enthusiasts swear they can't do without skim boarding. Such a gripping and interesting sport it is. The best point about skim boarding is that it performed in shallow waters and shallow waters are not very difficult to locate. \n\n\nBeaches are the most popular skim boarding spot. The sport may however as well be practiced in lakes and skim pools. Skim pools are especially designed low water bodies to practice skim boarding. Many amusement parks have come out with skim pools, of late. Some sport devotees have gone to the extent of developing a skim pool at their own premises.\n[[Skim boards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.skimboards/] are although small in size but their exact size will depend on the rider's height, overall built and experience. \n\nSkim boards are usually of two major types on the basis of what they are made up of. These are [[wood skim boards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.skimboards/] and skim boards made of foam. Skim boards made of foam are relatively more expensive than wooden skim boards as they are comparatively lighter. All skim boards are given a polyester coating to protect them from all possible damages.\nSkim boards are not difficult to find. One may easily get them from beach vendors or surf shops. One may search for them online as well. Another good deal can be hiring these skim boards on rent. The rentals depend on the type of skim board and the vendor but on the whole, rentals are very affordable and it is a wise decision to get them on rent rather than spending a bomb on purchasing one and later discarding it in the deepest corners of one's house. So, there is worth in hiring skim boards on a payment of meager rent. One should get them readily at popular beaches and surf shops.\n\n\nAnother popular beach sports is body boarding with [[bodyboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.bodyboards/] enjoying thrills of riding the surf.

      "description" : "==Breathtaking Water Towables==\n\n\nWater towables are toys which when inflated can be towed behind a boat. Water sport freaks are always on the lookout for some adventure. They are not afraid of high tides and ferocious waves. They love to play wild and fast on the water and take on to any water sport that guarantees them this fun. One may say they have a fetish for breathtaking water sports. Water towable sport is not as vigorous a sport as other water sports. In fact it is one amongst the least vigorous of all. It is also assumed to be a much safer water sport. \n\n\nWhatever it is, water towable is a water sport and as such it gets along all types of water risks as there can be. It is therefore important that the player knows swimming to say the least. As said above, water towable is an easy sport but in case of a mishap one must at least be able to swim through and save oneself. \n\n\n[[Water towables]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] come in a series of shapes and sizes. Apparently the size of the towable will depend on the number of people it can hold and carry along. If one plans to stuff a whole army of people inside, there will be a need to get a bigger towable. In case just a handful of people are to be seated, a smaller one would suffice!\n\n\n'''Safety of water towables''':-\nWater towable is a sport. Thousands of people take to it. Still, going inside the water is risky in itself by all means and thus the rider must play careful! First and foremost, the rider/s must wear a life saving jacket. For those who do not know the basics of swimming, it is not worthwhile to step into the ferociousness of the water. Risk comes with whatever one does in life. One must not ignore the risk rather steps should be taken to counter the risks.\n\n\n'''Storage of water towables''':-\nSo, when the towable has served its purpose, it is time to store it till its next use. The foremost part is to dry the towable of all possible moisture. Now why this is important is because even if the slightest of moisture is left behind, the towable is bound to give off the most horrible of all smells. The completely dry towable must then be stored in a cool and dark place so as to avoid any resultant expansion or contraction. It hence follows that the towable has to be both moisture and air free before storage in order to make it last longer. Last but not the least the towable must be stored at a place that one does not have a hard time searching for it next season.\n\n\nWater towable sport is a good way to spend some thrilling time with near and dear ones. There are many varieties of water towables to look out for. Towables come in interesting shapes and with varied features. Funky towable toys make the sporting experience all the more exhilarating and worth indulging. Another beach sports which has been become popular is body boarding with [[bodyboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.bodyboards/]  and sand skimming with [[skimboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.skimboards/]\n\n\n\n\n"

      "description" : "=Outdoor Umbrella Buying Guide=\n\n\n\n\nA patio umbrella is a must-have accessory to any outdoor furniture setup. They not only protect everyone from harmful UV rays, but they also add a stylish accent to your outdoor furnishings. They differ from regular umbrellas, and a buyer should take the special considerations into account before purchasing a outdoor umbrella: Fabric, size, tilt, venting, and UV resistance are but a few of the notable considerations. \n.\n.\n.\n.\nThere are two main types of [[outdoor umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.patio-umbrella/]. \n\n\n'''Patio Umbrella '''\nis the more basic unit with a pole that goes through the center of it. The pole then goes through the table and rests in an umbrella stand that is sitting on your deck or lawn. \n\n\n\n\n'''Offset Patio Umbrella / Cantilever Patio Umbrella '''\nprovides the same great shade, but without the pole going directly through the middle of your table. Instead, the pole is located off to the side, freeing up the center from this obstruction. If you do not want a table, then the freestanding patio umbrella will function perfectly fine without a table; however, you will need to use a heavier [[umbrella base]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/] in order to ensure the safety of your freestanding umbrella.\n\n\n\n\nThe conditions presented in the outdoors are less than hospitable. Therefore it is important to consider only garden umbrellas that are made of sturdy, strong materials, such as aluminum, wood, or fiberglass. Wood and aluminum are stronger materials, especially in comparison to their respective weights. However, aluminum can be bent, and wood can mold, warp, or crack if not properly cared for. Fiberglass, although heavier, has none of these drawbacks and is preferable for moist environments where corrosion inevitable. If you prefer the aluminum, choose a heavy duty, rust-resistant umbrella stand that comes with a good warranty. Commercial grade umbrellas are many times referred as [[Market Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.patio-umbrella/] and found in restuarant, parks, bistro and outdoor settings.\n\n\n\n\nThe outdoor umbrella is securely opened in one of several fashions. The crank type is probably the easiest to operate, but is most prone to failure. If you are looking for commercial patio umbrellas or a logo patio umbrella, then you would definitely be advised to consider the pulley and pin system or the even simpler push-up system, and ensure that its mounted on umbrella stand securely. The pulley and pin method uses a rope and pulley to open the umbrella, and a pin to secure it in place. The push-up system requires manually pushing up the umbrella and securing it open with a pin.\n\n\n\n\nThe umbrella tilt is a very desirable feature on any home garden umbrella. Some umbrellas that open by crank come with an auto-tilt feature, which will tilt the umbrella to your desired angle once the umbrella is open. This is convenient when the sun changes and you need to easily adjust the umbrella. Other types of tilt mechanisms include the push button tilt and the collar tilt. The collar tilt is the quickest and easiest and allows for the most control over your desired angle.\n\n\n\n\nRespected brand names to consider when purchasing a patio umbrella are California Umbrella, [[Galtech Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.galtech-umbrellas/], Fiberbuilt, Coolaroo, [[Green Corner Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.green-corner-umbrellas/], Rio Brand, Copa, Frankford, and SolarGuard\n"

      "description" : "=Beach Umbrella Buying Guide=\n \nEnjoy all the sun without all of the burn with a fashionable beach umbrella. No matter if you are in your private backyard or on a public beach in sunny Florida, they will allow you to enjoy the great outdoors while avoiding the dangers of the sun. In order to meet your personal style and needs, there are many options to consider when buying a sun shelter.\n\n'''UV Protection:'''\nThe primary decision that needs to be made before buying a beach umbrella is knowing where and how you intend to use it. Will you be outside/at the beach all day? Will you use sunblock in addition to the beach umbrella, or are you expecting the umbrella to be your only protection? \n\n'''UV Rating:'''\nThe product's main purpose is to protect us from the harmful effects of the sun. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends a minimum of 30 UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) for any skin-protective fabric. However, if you will be using it all day or are not using sunblock also, then look for a higher UPF number, which will offer more protection. Darker colors help to naturally block out more sunlight and vinyl, acrylic, and polyester are the best beach umbrella fabric options for blocking out the effects of the sun's rays. Beach Umbrellas made by [[SolarGuard Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/results.cgis?catalog=MFG&keywords=Solar Guard] offer UPF of 150+ and feels 15 deg. cooler in the shade.\n\n'''Frame Structure:'''\nThe stability and durability of your beach umbrellas is also very important. The ribs (the frame that supports the fabric and pushes it outward when you open the umbrella) are very important to help your sun shelter keep its shape. A strong wind can easily bend the ribs of an umbrella and even invert it. Fiberglass ribs are more flexible and will not flex or bend out of shape. Steel ribs are less desirable, especially in salty environments, where the ribs can easily rust and become destroyed. The white powder coating on the steel ribs will minimize the rusting.\n\n'''Pole:'''\nThe pole is the main support structure of your entire sun shelter. If weight is important to you, then aluminum is the best option. However, aluminum is not as strong as the other options. If strength is more important to you, then both wood and steel are much stronger than aluminum. However, steel can rust and wood can rot, so it is important that these poles be stored in a dry place. White powder coating on the steel pole will reduce the rusting. Most of the beach umbrellas are designed with the pole in two sections for portability. The folded length is usually from 30 to 50 inches.\n\n'''Beach Umbrella Holders:'''\nWind can be dangerous to any beach umbrella. Thus, Beach Umbrella Holder as is an essential accessory if you plan on using the umbrella on a beach. The material of a sand anchor is not as important as the weight and ability of the anchor to stay firmly attached to the ground. In areas of higher winds, the security of your anchor becomes increasingly important. \n\n'''Beach Umbrella Stands:'''\nAn umbrella base is equally important in order to provide a firm and flat surface for the umbrella. They allow the umbrella to stand upright and also protect your deck or ground while you are at home using your umbrella. Light and strong [[umbrella bases]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/] made of aluminum are an extra requirement on a windy beach. However, if you are planning on simply using your umbrella at home, then concrete, steel, or iron are ideal if you donât plan on moving your umbrella. Plastic and fiberglass, however, are more convenient and have the added benefit of not scratching up your walking surface.\n\n'''Air Vent:'''\nVenting is an important feature to consider when buying a beach umbrella, especially if you live in or will be traveling to a windy area. Venting, especially wide vents will allow trapped air to escape and protect your sun shelter from damage and prevent it from being picked up by the wind. \n\n'''Tilting:'''\nAnother important feature to look for in a beach umbrella is tilting. This allows you to adjust your umbrella in the optimum position in order to block the sun. However, be careful when using this feature during windy conditions, as damage may occur.\n\n'''Canopy Size:'''\nThe shade area is determined by the arc dimension of canopy dome, which ranges from 6 foot to 8 foot. The shade area may vary depending on time of the day and tilting position of the canopy. The valance skirting helps for additional shade area.\n    \nNo matter if you are on the beach or picnic site looking to catch up on your reading, or in your backyard next to your favorite picnic table, beach umbrellas are indispensable. The beach umbrellas provides you with the protection you require to maintain a healthy lifestyle without sacrificing your fun in the sun.\n"

Beach coolers ensure that the food remains ready to be served without any preparation.\n\n\nNow that one has made up his mind to head out for a picnic with friends or family, one would not want the heat to play havoc with the mood of the picnic. It is a usual scene that the food, liquids and the people themselves fall prey to the scorching heat making a nightmare out of the picnic. In a situation as this, [[picnic coolers]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] can come to your relief. A picnic cooler, now-a-days is a must-have in a picnic. It saves the food from spoilage. Not just this, the coolers also allow the food to be served without any manual preparation. Picnic coolers have come a long way and over the years they have evolved into handy, useful and high-tech pieces of machinery that add more color and vibrancy to the party spirit. Gone are the days when picnic food would be carried to the beach in a basket. Beach coolers and picnic coolers have evolved into [[picnic backpacks]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/#!picnic-backpacks/], totes with cooler compartments and even rolling picnic coolers (with wheels attached for easy mobility).\n\n\n===Variety of Styles and Sizes===\n\n\nPicnic coolers come in a variety of styles and sizes. The choice of a cooler depends on the weather and the type of food to be carried. Following are the different types of coolers for the people to choose from-\n<strong>Basic picnic coolers:</strong> In the very basic sense, picnic coolers are designed to keep the hot air out and to keep the food cold and fresh. Now-a-days picnic baskets have an in-built feature of a picnic cooler.\n\n<strong>Ice-chest: </strong>By allowing the food to be put on ice, an ice-chest promises to keep the food fresh for a relatively longer period of time. Most suitable for beverages, an ice-chest offers a helping hand. It does have its own disadvantages. Its huge size and rather awkward look is the major drawback.\n\n<strong>Ice-chest sans ice:</strong> Now this sounds rather funny. Such a cooler needs to be plugged into an outlet to be able to make it work. It has similar size hassles as with ice-chests.\n\n<strong>High-tech picnic coolers: </strong>Nothing gets better than these. They have almost everything one would want them to have- a compartment to store utensils, separate pockets for hot food and cold food, barbeque grill and more. They are obviously costlier than other normal picnic coolers.\n\n<strong>Trolley kind coolers: </strong>Now if the whole family decides to go for a picnic, the size of the cooler required will be obviously big. Trolley kinds suffice to such needs. These can easily store some 15 bottles besides food. The superior quality ones are more durable and heat resistant. The wheels make it easier to carry them all along the picnic. They also provide for separate apartments for various needs.\n\n<strong>Tote bag cooler:</strong> If a still smaller bunch of people set out for a picnic, a tote bag promises to fulfill the requirements. They offer many advantages- they are comparatively cheap, they are very easy to carry, they come with a variety of waterproof chambers and last but not the least they look trendy. So, for a small picnic they are ideal coolers.\nAll in all, it follows that depending on a particular familyâs needs, a cooler would be chosen. The family may have a hard time searching for the right one!\n\n\n==Coolers: Food for Thought==\n\n\nBeach Coolers enable you to prepare food for your family outing and ensure that it arrives at the beach and is ready to be served without any preparation. Present day coolers have an array of clips to secure plates, napkins and even a BBQ grill alongside thermally insulated compartments and pockets for hot or cold food or beverages. Not just limited to beach applications, coolers can also prove handy for trips to amusement parks, long drives and camping. \n\n\n==Cooler Than the Rest==\n\n\nOur range of beach coolers and picnic coolers is meant to suit every kind or requirement: \n<strong>For shorter trips:</strong> you could use a collapsible cooler which regulates temperature for shorter periods of time. \n\n<strong>For longer picnics:</strong> we offer picnic cooler with electric temperature regulating systems that run a 12V DC thermoelectric cooling unit on a car battery power outlet.\n\n<strong>For the more energy conscious:</strong> we even have a solar-powered cooler. Built-in speakers and an iPod charging dock ensure that you can add music to the mood."

      "description" : "= Market Umbrellas as a marketing tool=\n\n\nA market umbrella is an umbrella that is put up at commercial place. Such an umbrella can be put to many uses other than simply being used for providing shade. These [[market umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.patio-umbrella/] are being used as a source of advertisement at many places and these make a very good advertising agent.  Promotional umbrellas have become the most popular and cost effective way to advertise and promote different things. It is a very tried and tested way of increasing the brand awareness.  There are many different types of Market Umbrellas that can be used for the purpose of promotion of some product or brand.\n\n\n\n\nThere isn't anything like a market umbrella to dress up your outdoor spaces and give shade when you need it.  Installing a market umbrella is far less expensive than adding a patio cover, and shows off a unique style to any residential or commercial application.\n\n\n\n\nIn the commercial setting, there are specific things a good market umbrella like thes one made by [[Galtech Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.galtech-umbrellas/] will do; and that is to provide the right amount of shade while fitting into the space provided.  In some settings, a cantilever umbrella is the ideal shade shelter.  However, because the umbrella base of a cantilever umbrella is typically quite large, this type of umbrella may work well in corners where people will not be walking.  \n\n\nAt a cafe or restaurant, commercial umbrellas fill the need for shade in a classy way.  It is important that the market umbrella used in a commercial setting be paired with the proper [[umbrella base]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/], and that it carries certain features.  Here's the thing:  hands both big and little will be tempted to play with certain types of commercial umbrellas. That's right.  Crank mechanisms for opening and closing market umbrellas are easy to use; and that means customers can use them as well as staff.  The problem with this is that if a waiter or waitress is walking past a table where the customer is putting down the umbrella with a crank mechanism, they may be hit by the swift moving arms coming down.  Disaster.  For restaurants especially, it is important that market umbrellas have a manual lift and a pin to hold in place and sturdy mounted on [[umbrella stands]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.umbrella-stand-stands-base/] \n\n\n\n\nMarket umbrellas were once the name for wood umbrellas only.  But today the term market umbrella and patio umbrella are really interchangeable.  Material is now irrelevant for the most part.  A market umbrella can be made with a wood pole and wood arms; or with a wood pole and fiberglass arms.  Fiberglass arms (or ribs) are best for windy areas because there is some give to them.  \n\n\n\n\nIn any setting where a market umbrella will be open for extended periods of time, the material used in the shade is also important.  Some materials will fade far sooner than others.  Sunbrella fabric is the very best fabric available for commercial and market umbrellas whether they are to be used at home or in a commercial setting.  Sunbrella fabric is treated to resist fading for several years; and most owners of Sunbrella umbrellas report that the material outlasts even the warranty. Popular market umbrellas for high commercial use made by [[Green Corner Umbrellas]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.green-corner-umbrellas/] can last for years and most parts are easily replaceable.  \n\n\n\n\nMarket umbrellas dress up any space with a look like nothing else can provide.  When you take the time to purchase the right umbrella, you will be treated to years of shade and style on the patio.\n"

      "description" : "=Picnic and Beach Coolers Buying Guide=\n\n\n\n\nSurfing the waves, playing in the sand, and of course enjoying the sun always results in one thing: hunger. And when hunger strikes, nobody wants to gather all of their stuff together, load it into a car, and go out to eat. To ease this burden, you will bring along your favorite cold drinks and some delicious sandwich makings. In order to keep your cold foods cold, you will most certainly need a [[beach cooler]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-cooler/] or a beach chair with a cooler. These wonderful inventions are able to hold a single drink or a meal for an entire family and have become indispensable on your beach chairs for any beach trip.\n\n\n\n\nFor those times when going to the beach is just too much work, but you want to enjoy the fresh air outside, then consider a picnic cooler. Same great function as a beach cooler, except with a few accessories to make your picnic experience easier and more enjoyable. Many picnic basket coolers come with plates, glasses, napkins, and bottle openers. This is the ideal picnic solution, if you just want to grab your food and go.\n\n\n\n\nThe needs for various kinds of beach and [[picnic baskets]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-baskets/] have progressed over the many decades and centuries since the first picnic. The collapsible [[picnic coolers]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.picnic-ascot-accessories/] are ideal for shorter trips since they are able to keep foods at their proper temperatures adequately for shorter periods of time. Durable and spacious when opened to full size, they can be collapsed down to two inches for easy storage and transportation.\n\n\n\n\nThe insulated [[beach bags]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.beach-bags-totes/] have all of the benefits of a beach cooler, except that it is more compact, and easier to carry around. They are ideal for car trips, transporting frozen goods, or sporting events. Insulated beach totes are able to hold about 20 beverage cans and have spacious pockets for many other uses. Some picnic and beach bags have a mini refrigerator built in, so that it can be kept cool (especially on long trips) just by plugging it into a vehicle's 12 DC power outlet.\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional woven basket has one shortcoming: it isn't insulated in any fashion. Thus, when going on a picnic, you could normally take only room-temperature foods. But with the picnic basket cooler, you are able to store hot or cold foods, and they will stay that way. This allows your foods to stay fresher and taste better when you reach your picturesque dining location to enjoy your feast.\n\n\n\n\nThe [[picnic backpack]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.picnic-time-backpacks/] or the picnic cooler on wheels are the ultimate in food and drink portability. They are thermally insulated to keep your cold foods cold or your hot foods hot for several hours, but they also have a separate compartment to store your personal belongings and other necessities for a day hike. \n\n\n\n\nHere are some non-traditional uses of a beach or picnic basket:\n*Theme park\n*Long Drives\n*Camping\n*Hikes (Especially with a backpack style picnic basket)\n*Potluck\n*Work party\n*Family gatherings\n*Sporting events\n*Shopping\n"

They are essentially required to stock tableware and food. Picnic baskets may be either simple or highly elaborate and detailed. The choice of picnic basket (or any other picnic accessory for that matter) depends on the number of people quite logically. Picnic baskets contain separate cabins and compartments and hence they allow neat and orderly storage of all the picnic accessories.\n\n\n\n\nPicnic baskets for 2 are more commonly known as romantic picnic baskets. They are especially made keeping in view the minutest requirements of the couple. As these baskets are designed to serve only 2 people, they are rather small but they essentially contain all the picnic requisites. They contain 2 sets of cutlery, 2 napkins and 2 sets of all other picnic essentials. It is not that only a couple will require a picnic basket for 2. At times, two friends may decide to head off for a picnic. Whatever it is, when two people choose to go out on a picnic, picnic baskets for 2 serve as useful picnic accessories.\nWhile selecting a picnic backpack, a person must look out for a combination of style and utility. [[Picnic backpacks for 4]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-accessories.picnic-backpack/] are readily obtainable. In fact, they are the most sought after of all picnic backpacks, totes and other shoulder bags. They are spacious and contain a lot many pockets to store various knick knacks. There are special picnic backpacks for 4 and shoulder bags available in the market. Children backpacks are highly glossy and dazzling. They are equipped with essential zipped and mesh pockets to stock things. Since these are backpacks for 4 people, they contain 4 sets of everything. For example, they contain 4 spoons, 4 wine glasses, 4 plates, 4 napkins etc. Some backpacks also contain inbuilt coolers and insulators. They help to protect the food from extreme temperature changes. \n\n\n\n\nInitially picnic baskets used to be really bulky. They would literally weigh down a person. Of late, lightweight baskets have hit the market. They weigh very less but are even more useful than the traditional heavyweight baskets. The modern picnic baskets are not only highly functional but stylish to boot. These solid picnic backpacks come in various different fabrics although canvas backpacks are the most common of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicnic baskets for 2 may also be presented to a lovely couple as a gift on their anniversary or just about on any other occasion. Likewise, picnic backpacks for 4 serve as wondrous gifts. Wicker baskets look all the more cute and special.\nWhether it is prairies or heightened mountains or dark deep woods, picnic baskets help the picnickers a great deal. They provide the much required help to store delicacies and cutlery. All in all, picnic baskets make sure that the indomitable picnic spirit is not dampened in any way. They not only act as items of great utility but also as items of much greater visual appeal.

      "description" : "=BodyBoards for Surfing=\n\nBodyboards (often called boogie boards) offer unlimited thrills of riding the surf and are fast becoming extremely popular [[bodyboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] including popular brand morey bodyboard. \nTired of staring at the surf from a beach chair. Why don't you try body boarding? This fast growing trendy water sport is a fun variant of surfing. You can enjoy all the thrills of traditional bodyboarding surfing with certain modern techniques, such as:\n* spinning\n* reverse direction changes\n* cutbacks \n* aerial moves (if the waves are strong and big enough) \n\n=Bodyboard Parts:=\n\t\n'''Deck:'''\nTop surface of the boogie board where you ride\nSlick bottom: Bottom side of the body board that has smoother or slick material \nlike Surlyn (used in golf balls) or HDPE (High Density Polyethylene)\n'''Tail:'''\nThe rear end side of the body board either in bat or crescent shape. The bat shape is the one with round shape on the middle pointing outside. The crescent one has square corners with 'U' shaped connector.\n'''Channels:'''\nGouged-out surface are on the bottom side that reduces contact with surf water and provides increase speed and better control\n'''Stringer:'''\nA metal straight rod which is inserted into the body board for stiffness.\n'''Nose:'''\nThe front of the body board where you hold grip to\n'''Rail:'''\nThe sides of the body boards are referred as rails. It's usually a ratio like 50/50 or 60/40.  The 50/50 rail is faster and more stable compared to a 60/40 which has more control and makes easier manoeuvres. The 60/40 body boards are very common\n'''Mesh:'''\nA wire-like plastic part inserted into the core construction of body boards for enhancing projection and durability.  It's used by few manufactures like Morey Body boards\n'''Template:'''\nAlso known as the overall shape\n'''Rocker:'''\nrefers to the flatness of body board surface. The nose shaped curve is going to keep the nose off the sea level, but the tail should be flat and the board shouldn't move more than one inch. Too much rocketing will decrease the speed.  The rocker shape will change depending on the material used between deck, core and bottom. Most Bodyboard will change the shape to a reverse rocker making the nose to dive into the curl of a wave (usually when Drop Knee riding). Keep your body board in a cool place and store your board on the nose to delay the reverse rocker from happening.\n\n=BodyBoards: Steps for Selecting One=\n\nFollow these essential steps to choose the best body boards:\n* Choose a body board with a smooth surface. Some cheap ones have porous surfaces. These tend to waterlog easily and become heavy. They are made from foam type of polyethylene.\n* Check the tail of the board. A beginner must use a board that has an inward-curving tail and a downward slope.\n* Ensure that the board sits flat on the ground and does not rock to and fro. Feel the body board for flex by placing the rear end of the board against your stomach and grabbing the nose. The more the flex, the better will be the performance of the body board. Flat board is good for high speeds. The ones with slight rise (not more 1.5 inches) on the nose and tail provide better turning on rides.\n* Wider boards are designed for smaller surfs and the narrow one for larger surf... Wide boards are recommended for heavy riders who are small in size. \n* The length of the board should be less than one inch of your belly button from the tail point when upright position. To enjoy the big waves choose one inch below or one inch above for smaller waves. \n\n=BodyBoards: Styles and Features=\nWe offer a wide range of good quality body boards that are made of light-weight, durable and water resistant materials. They have detachable wrist leashes that keep the board close to your body in case of a spill. A choice of 'crescent' or 'bat-shaped' tail provides the cheap bodyboard differing directional control and grip. Crescent tails offer better control while riding steep waves. However, if you are the kind of body boarder who likes to slide around, a bat shaped tail is what you need.\n\n=BodyBoard Accessories:=\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n\n'''Leash Plug:''' \nAnything that is at least 4 inches long and go through the built-in hole in the bodyboard (maybe a screwdriver).  Usually body boarders prefer to have leash about 8 inches down from the nose of the board in the center. Some adjust the leash about 6 inches from either side based on their length or foot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n\n'''Wax:''' \nIt's used for better grip of the board.  It's recommended that you don't wax the entire deck or nose surface of the board so that you body can be in the middle for 360 turns or your hips to have contact to the tail for prone riding.\n&lt;li&gt;\n\n'''Swim fins:''' \nThey help in all manuearues of bodyboarding for steering, moving towards waves, paddling away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;  "

Many a times it happens that couples, families, friends, or even loners go to beach for spending quality time and for spending time away from the hustle and bustle of the fast moving life. Many of us love to spend time on beaches and go for picnic to a beach. There is only one thing that bothers people while planning a picnic to the beach is the harmful sun rays. Security of all sorts is very important even when having a fun time. The rays of sun especially the ultra violet rays are very harmful for the skin. These rays not only harm our skin but also ruin the texture of the hair. In such a case the Beach Cabanas comes for the rescue of the people and gives them a chance to enjoy to the fullest without getting worried.\n\n\nIt is very important to carry along something to the beach that will be able to protect you and all the people accompanying you from the harmful sunrays so that one can enjoy completely.

It is known for providing the maximum shade and protection from the sun.  These are made usually from the tough marine grade material and therefore can be used for years to come.  They are very strong and sturdy and promise durability. The Beach Cabana is something which is known for its sturdiness. For making the Beach Cabana durable and robust the material used for making the Beach Cabana is undergone many processes.

      "description" : "==Comfy Ostrich Beach Chairs and Chaise Loungers==\n\n\n\n\nBeach accessories have witnessed a revolution with the advent of ostrich beach chairs and chaise loungers. [[Ostrich beach chairs]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/BCOST3N1] are one of its kinds when it comes to luxury and comfort. These comfortable chairs allow a person to lie back comfortably and while away a lazy Sunday morning.\nOstrich beach chairs have created a wave about themselves in the market. They were introduced in the market in 2003. They have come a long way since then and today they are indeed the most sought after beach chairs. Not only this, ostrich chairs also serve as great pool side and garden chairs. The peculiar feature is to allow a person to lay his back and enjoy a novel or a sun bath more comfortably. This is the reason why these chairs are more commonly called as 'Face-down loungers'.\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea to build up an [[ostrich chair]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/WOSMINB/] was to develop a comfy lounger with strategic holes and wide arms so as to provide more comfort to the user. These luxurious chairs are basically multipurpose in nature as they provide 5 different reclining positions. Furthermore, the chairs come with varied footrest positions.\nOstrich beach chairs are extremely lightweight even though they are made from sturdy hardwood, rust-proof metallic frame and durable textile fabric. This makes the chairs extremely easy to move, drag, fold and unfold.\nThe following lines help to provide an insight into the basic mechanism of ostrich chairs and chaise loungers. The fundamental feature of ostrich chairs is to provide easy and comfortable reading. To be able to do this, the chairs are strategically hollowed at peculiar points. These armholes and face cavity allow a person to lie down on the stomach and enjoy a book. The padded arm and head slots provides extra comfort. The person has to just place the book on the sand, lay back on the stomach and enjoy the book. The folding chaise allows a person to easily pack and unpack the chair. On folding, the chair contracts into a compact shape thereby allowing easy movement. Besides all these advantages, ostrich beach chairs look amazingly attractive.\n\n\n\n\nThese relaxing chairs come in such varied sizes that they are indeed capable of accommodating people of all shapes and sizes. Although all beach recliners are heat, water and weather resistant but it still pays to look into the quality and durability off the chairs beforehand. Low-grade quality chairs start to throw problems pretty soon. Their fabric begins to rip away after few uses only. As such, a little pre-research guarantees durability and permanence of the chair.\nThese ultra comfy beach chairs and chaise recliners come in a variety of sizes, colors, styles and designs. A prospective buyer must consider all of the above before making the final deal.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more? Ostrich beach loungers and recliners come at unbelievably affordable rates. As such, [[ostrich 3N1 beach chair]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/product/BCOST3N1/] is not only luxurious but an economical solution to beach recliners. The portable beach ostrich chairs go into doubling the enjoyment and excitement at the beach.\n"

      "description" : "=Skim Boards=\n\n\nMaking the choice of [[skimboard]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] with so many options around is never an easy task. However, it is critical to make the right choice, since this is what will determine what you experience. They are used for either sand skimming or wave riding.\n\n\n=Structure of SkimBoards:=\nAll skim boards are either oval or in teardrop shape. Most skim boards are between 3/8 to 5/8 inches in thickness. Skim boarders use three types of rockers:\n'''Constant rocker:'''\nIts curved on the entire length with full arc shape from tip to tail ends. This is mostly used by daily skim boarders, as it provides better control but slows the speed when moving to the wave.\n'''Traditional rocker:''' \nThis is completely flat.\n'''Hybrid rocker:''' \nThis has a curved bottom.\n\n\n=How to Buy SkimBoard:=\n'''Look at Material:'''\nIf you're headed for a beach with flatter surf,wooden skimboard boards (made of various kinds of wood) are ideal. However, for riding the waves, more advanced and synthetic constructions are used. Fiberglass is used to lend a smooth finish to the board. Aluminum is coated on Texalium boards to make them shiny. Carbon fiber is used to make extremely light but sturdy boards.\n\n\n'''Board Tail:''' \n[[SkimBoards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] with pin tails are used in sand skim boarding. Beginners use it because they need a stable board to learn the art. Boards with square or 'W' shaped tails are used in wave riding skimboards.\n\n\n'''Weight, Age and Ability:''' \nYou need to take into account your weight, age and ability while deciding on a skim board. Each board carries a weight guideline, which you should stick to. Each Manufacturer has different sizing. Usually riders who like more maneuverability on the wave or good drop prefer to use small size than recommended. Larger boards help to move father distance but slows down the turning of the board. Slight larger skim boards is recommended for learners.\n\n\n=Skim Boards We Offer:=\nWe offer skim boards of all sizes and shapes. Our fiberglass skimboards, available with catchy templates, ensure optimum speed and maneuverability. These are ideal for intermediate and expert skim boarders. Wooden skimboards with attractive graphics are perfect for beginners."

Things can be loaded into it and carried to a backyard party or to move bulk of books from one room to another.  The primary consideration prior to buying such carts that one must bear is that  it should have a good load bearing capacity. There are carts which can bear loads from fifty lbs to six hundred lbs. If the car is small and the space is quite limited in the house too, then go for a smaller one. Even with a smaller beach  cart the number of trips will be lesser than carrying them individually. There are beach carts which are like rolling beach loungers and others can turn into a table as well. The larger ones have pneumatic tires which make it easy to roll them without any hassles. The tires used for rolling on the sand are specially made to allow easy movement on the sand. .\n\n\nAnother variety is the foldable wheels beach cart. It can carry up to 165 lbs over the sand very easily. Apart from their use on the beach, the carts are useful at many other places as well. It can be used to carry things from the garden shed to the backyard. Wonder wheeler is unique as it has pivoting front wheel and wide based rear wheels which make it easier to roll on any kind of surface. It has a removable tote bag that can be used to store several belongings. It can carry up to four chairs at a time owing to their exceptional load carrying capacity. The best part of it is that it folds flat so takes little space for storage. \n"

      "description" : "=Trendy and Designer Kids Swimwear=\n\nSwimming is one of the most vital exercises that attract young kids these days. Kids are fond of all outdoor activities and love to go to swimming. They are very much excited by the whole idea of going for this activity and to make their activity more colorful and bright, different styles of swim wears have been introduced in the market.\n\n\nIf parents think that [[kids swimwear]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.kids-beachwear/] is just about picking up a pair of swimming trunks and nice swim suits, then this means that they are under informed about the latest trends and accessories that have been designed especially for kids. The swimsuit market has introduced a variety of colorful, bright, trendy and designer accessories to make the kids dress up amazingly and beautifully. The joy of having grown up kids is to dress them wonderfully and interestingly for every occasion of their lives whether for a social gathering, or for a pool party. It is very delightful to watch kids dressed up in cool and trendy clothes and this holds true for kidsâ swimwear also.\n\n\nThere are different kinds of swim suits available in the market for making a choice for both small girls and boys. For girls, swimsuits are available in different colors and designs and for each age group. These days kidsâ swimwears are different than those which were worn earlier and are available in all sizes. For junior girls more modest swim suits have been designed as these are comfortable to wear. A two piece suit will not serve the purpose of providing small kids with both comfort and trendy look as these suits contain numerous elastics that are not soothing while wearing. These swim suits may also move around when she is playing or while doing some activity, which can make her feel embarrassed. So girls swimwear in a single piece are usually preferred, as they are more soothing and does not make child feel self conscious. These are available in different bright colors and unique designs in the market.\nWhen it comes to boys for shopping for swimwear, then it is an easy task due to less variance available for them as compared to girlâs swimsuits. Swimwear for boys comes in two different varieties of trunk styles and Speedos. Some boys have favoritism for Speedos, while other like trunk styles. However, a person should go for that swimwear that is latest in trend and provides most comfort to his kid.\n\n\nThe latest addition in the range of kids swimwear is children's SPF swimwear. These swimsuits have been endorsed by organizations and physicians such as Skin Cancer Foundation and these have proven to offer their consumers most stylish and comfortable means for protecting them from skin problems. With these wears the sun rays are blocked to almost 98% which helps in protecting kids from various skin diseases that can arise due to sun exposure. Another item for consideration when at the beach is the [[beach shelter]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-umbrellas-shelter.beach-tent-shelters/]\n\n\nThe only thing that should be remembered while selecting swim suit for a junior is that it should fit him properly and soothe him. Their bathing suits have adjustable straps or draw strings that can be adjusted with their growing age, so there is no need for parents to buy large sized swimwear for their kids that will make them look clumsy and funny.\n\n \n"

      "description" : "=BeachWear: Rashguard Buying Guide=\n\nRashes from sliding or falling on sand, from rubbing against coral, or from the sand that sticks to the wax of surf and [[bodyboards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-sports.bodyboards/] are a common problem present in many oceanic activities. Sometimes a rash can form from too much contact with the wax itself if you have sensitive skin. The solution is the rashguard. [[Rashguards]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beach-chairs.beach-gear.kids-beachwear/] (sometimes called rash shirts) are outdoor shirts used in athletic activities to protect your chest and arms while surfing, body-boarding, or body surfing. Rash shirts are typically made out of spandex and nylon or polyester. These materials are naturally lightweight, quick drying, flexible, durable, naturally antibacterial, and water wicking.\n\n\n \nBoardshorts are a great complement to rashguard shirts. They provide the wearer a bit of protection against the elements of sun, sand, coral, and wax. They are usually made of the same materials as rashguard shirts. It can be fun to mix different prints and styles of [[boardshorts]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear/] to coordinate with the rashguard shirt. Many times the boardshorts are sold with the shirts though, so it is not hard to match.\n\n\nSome important elements to look for in boy's rashguards and girl's rashguards and boardshorts are that they provide an adequate amount of UV protection. Ultra violet protection (UPF) of at least 50 is recommended for all clothes intended to be worn outside on the beach. This is especially true for children, toddlers, and babies. If greater amounts of protection are required, then you should look for [[Beach Swimwear]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/category/beachwear.beach-swimwear/] like long-sleeve shirts instead to protect the arms.\n\n\nThe best rash guards are constructed using a triple flat lock stitches along every seam. This makes for a garment that is very strong, and it will not cause friction along the wearer's body, nor will it leave indentations in your skin. Look for a rip-stop material.\n\n\nSome girls' bikinis now can be bought with a rashguard, as a three-piece purchase. This is a great way to get your daughter or little sister to practice safe skin care, since some girls can be picky about matching just so. The rashguard can be worn with the girl's bikini and double as a cover-up when walking on the beach.\n\n\nThe same is true for boys' rashguards. If you look at the right specialty stores, you can find boy's swimshorts alongside matching boys' rashguards.\n\n\nRash shirts come in all different styles: long-sleeve, three-quarter length, no sleeves, etc. Long-sleeved rash shirts are best for people who body surf (ride the waves without a body board) because their arms are more likely to come in contact with the sand if they ride the waves all the way to shore. They are also good for the more sun-conscious or fair-skinned individuals who like to stay in the sun under beach hats all day without reapplying sunblock every hour or so. While three-quarter length can be a happy medium for some, they can leave a funny tan line, so that is something to think about. Sleeveless rashguards are popular kids swimsuit and best for those who simply want some good protection for their chest\n"

The decision as regards color is also a vital one. Also, some find such furniture uncomfortable. In a case as this one may consider getting the extra comfort from cushions and padding. There is always an option to refine the furniture in the moment of it being tight on the bones. In case of Adirondack chairs, it is advisable that one goes in for a chair that does not have much of a lean. Some Adirondack chairs allow the lean to be adjusted. In case there is no such provision, purchase one with already an adjusted lean. Some chairs also provide for a cross legged system. They are supposed to provide a much comfortable sitting.\n\n\n==Caring for Adirondack furniture==\n\n\nAny kind of furniture requires maintenance and upkeep. Adirondack furniture requires it all the more.\nFirstly, it is important to know that Adirondack furniture has the capacity to turn gray over a period of time. The process of such a discoloration is known as patina. Usually some sprays are available to combat patina. The furniture must also be kept well sealed.\nNow if the furniture is lying idle for long in the open, is it not a good idea to get it inside? When not in use, why leave it to the sole mercy of the weather?\nThere is absolutely no way one can do without a sealant. As said before, it is important that the Adirondack furniture be treated with a sealant. The wood of the furniture is immaterial.\n\n\n==Product Types and Materials==\n\n\nThey are usually made from cedar, pine, cypress, teak or environment friendly recycled plastic. Adirondack products come in several styles including Adirondack chairs, gliders, ottoman foot rest, rockers, tables, swings and benches. \n\n\n==Features==\n\nSeat cushions and pillow are good choice for added comfort and relaxation with your [[Patio Umbrella]:url=http://www.beachmall.com/#!market-patio-umbrellas/]. You can choose various styles, sizes and colors to match your room or outdoor patio. Many of them are designed as reversible for different looks.\n"

      "description" : "= Wooden Beach Chairs =\n\n\nThere are a plethora of factors to be considered before one hit on the right wood beach chair for the summer. The durability of chairs, the physical appeal of chairs, the comfort and the portability of wooden beach chairs has to be taken into consideration before choosing the final one. The pros and cons of each one of them need to be clearly evaluated. All this while, more stress must be laid on durability and comfort rather than appeal.\n\n\nThe array of [[wooden beach chairs]:url=http://www.beachmall.com] is wide and includes chairs made from different fabrics and materials. When it comes to choosing the right beach chair both fabric and size are important considerations. The material may be either ployester or arcylic canvas or wooden. In case of wooden chairs, there is a need to provide extra comfort with the help of padding or cushions. Likewise the stand may be made from aluminum, steel or wood. Similarly, the size of the chair may be small, medium or large. Children, for example would need small sized loungers.\n\n\nWood beach chairs are gaining popularity by the day and these are outdoing metal frames. Despite these being costlier than ordinary metal and steel frames, more and more people seem to be fascinated by the idea of wooden beach chairs. These beach chairs, as the name itself is suggestive, are made from rugged seating fabric and wooden frame. The wooden frame provides the chairs with an altogether different appeal and strength.\nCanvas and wooden beach chairs offer many irresistible features. The hardwood used is more resistant to weather harshness. The chairs are more sturdy and durable than what they appear to be. They can be reclined to different positions. They can be easily packed and moved from one place to another. Whatâs more they look amazingly superb and wonderful! Some people mistake wooden chairs to be heavy than routine beach chairs but such people will be flabbergasted after getting to know how lightweight these wooden beach chairs can be! These days special care is given by the manufacturers to the weight of the beach chairs knowing that the chairs will have to be constantly moved, folded and unfolded.\n\n\nThese wooden beach chairs may be further subdivided into categories as listed below:\n\n\n'''Canvas backrest, wooden seat'''\n- In these low lying chairs only the backrest is made from rugged cloth, rest all is made out of hardwood. These chairs usually come with detachable shoulder straps thereby providing extra ease in movement. People who are on the lookout for comfortable backrest need not go anywhere else.\n\n\n'''Canvas backrests, canvas seat'''\n- Unlike the former kinds of chairs, these types of chairs provide a canvas seat. A canvas seat allows for a more relaxing seating provision. These come with multiple pockets and pouches to enable easy storage. A more modified version contains insulated compartments to store drinks and beverages.\nWooden beach chairs include all that a person may want in a beach chair. The type of wood used must however be inquired into. If the wood used is of inferior quality, the whole purpose of an outdoor chair is washed away! \n\n\nSome consideration should be done for beach umbrellas for UV protection from harmful UV rays. Rio Beach Chairs manufactures wooden beach chair made from birch wood and can be used for your backyard or the beach."
