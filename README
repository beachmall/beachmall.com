Homepage Main Banner:
The main homepage banner is set with a JSON file in the root folder of the project: _banners.json
Each attribute for the image can be changed by editing the content between the quotes to the right of 
the : for that attribute. 
Edit the image used by changing the path listed in the "src" object.
Edit the alternate and title test by changing the text listed in the "alt" and "title" objects. 
Edit the destination of the link by changing the hash listed in the "href" object.
Stray characters, such as commas or spaces, will prevent the banner from displaying correctly. 
Testing that any changes made were done correctly is highly recomended. 

Brands Category Content:
To enter manufacturer name, coupon code, banner image, and page description for the top
section in a brands category the layout should be switched to data entry:
~category_dataentry_20130423
The content can then be populated for the category. 
Switch the layout back to the appropriate layout (previous layout) once the content has been added.
